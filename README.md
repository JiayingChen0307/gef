# Evaluate the impacts of GEF interventions on childrens' health conditions in Kenya

The study aims to estimate the impacts of GEF interventions on the health conditions of children under five years in Kenya, focusing on health measures including the prevalence of diarrhea and coughs. Our study found a 15% reduction in the prevalence of coughs within 5 km from the intervention areas and a 7% reduction in the prevalence of diarrhea was found with a distance smaller than 3 km. Besides the direct measure of health outcomes, GEF interventions also demonstrated positive impacts on a few intermediate outcomes, including water quality, water accessibility, and the use of less  solid fuels. These variables were proven to be risk factors for diarrhea and/or coughs from previous studies. However, the estimated impacts on the health metrics were observed when the intermediate outcomes were controlled, meaning that GEF projects influenced the metrics through other ways that have not yet been recognized.

Based on our study, we recommend the following steps to further understand the relationships between GEF interventions and the prevalence of diarrhea and coughs among children:
* Identify other causal linkages between GEF interventions and the studied health outcomes
* Perform the analysis with more precise distance measures when the polygon data for biodiversity and land degradation projects are available
